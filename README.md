# tunangn-html-modal
Use to show dialog, message for HTML. You can use this package easily to manage your dialog, snackbar or side in your **Vanilla Javascript** (**Plain Javascript**) Project. Ensure for privacy!! Dialog, side and snackbar only show (in screen or in DON Tree) if them are opened.

## Install
You can install it by:
```js
npm install tunangn-html-modal
```

Or just use CDN Link:

`index.html`
```html
<script type="module">
  import { dialog } from "";
</script>
```

Or `index.js`:
```js
import { dialog } from "";
```
